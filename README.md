## Program Description
- Ask user if they want to play
    - End program if they do not want to play
- Ask user to answer a variety of questions
- +1 to their score for each correct answer
- At the end of the program, print the number of correct answers out of how many total questions and the percentage correct

## Learnings
- Use of the `.lower()` method to convert strings into all lowercase letters
    - This is useful when needing to ignore case-sensitivity of an `input` for an `if` statement expecting a result in all lowercase
- `+=` will add to the existing variable value and then update the variable with this new value
